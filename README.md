## Machine Learning Application - Malware detection 

## About

Malware is currently one of the biggest cyberthreats due to the Internet's rapid expansion. Malware is any software that carries out malicious tasks, such as espionage, information theft, etc. Malware is "a type of computer program designed to infect a legitimate user's computer and inflict harm on it in multiple ways," according to Kaspersky Labs (2017).
In the past, traditional malware detection techniques have served as the mainstay of cybersecurity initiatives. Although these traditional methods—such as sandboxing, heuristic analysis, signature-based detection, and the use of white and blacklists—have advantages, they also have serious drawbacks, especially in the face of increasingly complex cyberthreats. 


## Project Description

This project applies the Random Forest classifier as a classification technique which is effective at identifying malware in a dataset.
